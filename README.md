# Serenade.js for Ruby

[Serenade.js] is a JavaScript client side MVC framework. This gem makes Serenade.js
available for usage with [Sprockets], or the asset pipeline in Ruby on Rails version
3.1 or later.

[serenade.js]: https://github.com/elabs/serenade.js
[sprockets]: http://rubygems.org/gems/sprockets

## Installation

To use Serenade with Rails, add Serenade to the assets group in your Gemfile:

``` ruby
group :assets do
  gem "serenade", :require => "serenade/rails"
end
```

You can now require Serenade in your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` file:

``` javascript
//= require serenade
// Include folder of views (*.serenade)
//= require views
```

Serenade should now be loaded and ready. See the [Serenade README] for examples.

### Using Serenade with Sprockets

If you are not using Rails, you can still use Serenade with just Sprockets:

``` ruby
gem "serenade", :require => "serenade/sprockets"
```

Youâ€™ll also need to register the Serenade asset path with your Sprockets environment.

``` ruby
sprockets.append_path Serenade::ASSET_PATH
```

## Serenade.js views and the asset pipeline

Serenade.js allows Sprockets or the Rails asset pipeline to compile your Serenade
views for you, just use the extension `.serenade` on any asset file.  Your views
will be precompiled server-side before being served to the client.

For example, if you create the following view in `app/assets/javascripts/test.serenade`:

``` serenade
h1 "Hello " @name
```

Now you can render this view:

``` javascript
var model = new Serenade.Model({ name: "Vega" })
document.body.appendChild(Serenade.render('test', model));
```

And, like in all Serenade.js views, you can change your model and see the DOM
update itself accordingly:

``` javascript
model.name = "Mercedes" // HTML now says <h1>Hello Mercedes</h1>
```

### A note about the view path

If the path to your view starts with `views`, that initial part is stripped off,
so you could have placed the above view in `app/assets/javascripts/views/test.serenade`
without changing the code.
